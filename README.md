task-dashboard-bpms-angular-app
==============

*This project is composed of two modules:

1) bpms-angularjs-tasklist: A angularjs 2 app wired together using require.js, package in a Java WAR. It provides a dashboard of human tasks managed in the BPM Suite runtime by integrating with the task query API (link)
2) bpms-remote-client: A simple usage of the jbpm (link)

The deployment of this project is described in a Dockerfile (link) and which has been built and pushed to docker hub (link).

Thanks for Becca Kreuter (link) for developing much of the JS and Matyas Danter (link) for some of the original code to get this bootstraped.
